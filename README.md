# Adaptive Tamil Translation System (Phase 2)

## Abstract
Existing translation systems provide single-pass translations without considering user comprehension. This project introduces an adaptive Tamil translation system that integrates user feedback, iterative simplification, and a quantitative comprehension metric.

## Key Contributions
- Any-language → Tamil translation
- Iterative simplification loop
- Comprehension Effort Score (CES)
- Human-in-the-loop feedback modeling
- Audio + PDF multimodal output

## Novelty Compared to Existing Systems
| Feature | Google Translate | Proposed System |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Iterative understanding | ❌ | ✅ |
| User feedback loop | ❌ | ✅ |
| CES metric | ❌ | ✅ |
| Simplification on demand | ❌ | ✅ |
| Research analytics | ❌ | ✅ |

## CES Definition
CES = Number of simplification attempts required before user acceptance.

## Conclusion
The system demonstrates that translation quality should be measured not only by linguistic accuracy but also by user comprehension.
